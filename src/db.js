    Paetongtarn, the 31st Prime Minister of Thailand Politics 16 Aug
    2024 LISTEN soundwave Pheu Thai leader Paetongtarn Shinawatra
    was elected by parliament as the 31st prime minister of
    Thailand, becoming the third member of the Shinawatra family to
    hold the top job, following her father, Thaksin, and her aunt,
    Yingluck. Paetongtarn succeeds Srettha Thavisin, who was ousted
    by the Constitutional Court this week. She was the only
    candidate nominated for the position. She won with 319 votes in
    favour, 145 votes against and 27 abstentions. She needed at
    least 248 votes to win. Nicknamed “Ung Ing”, Paetongtarn, 37,
    becomes the youngest prime minister of Thailand and the second
    female. She is the third child of Thaksin Shinawatra and
    Khunying Potjaman Na Pombejra. Paetongtarn gave birth to her
    second child during the general election campaign in May last
    year. Paetongtarn was not in Parliament today for her
    nomination, because she is not an MP. Reports indicate that she
    is following developments from the former Voice TV station
    facility. Her victory was assured, though, as the leaders of the
    nine government coalition parties appeared yesterday at a press
    conference, hosted by Pheu Thai, to announce her nomination.
